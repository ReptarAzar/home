Mesh networks.. more on that later.

Something for a while has been telling me that <strong>it's time to help</strong>. Friends and colleauges work in Liberia on Ebola. A move to San Francisco, the fertile crecent of inspiration. And a little article by Ella about doing what we must. Service has been a big part of my life and I want that piece back, but I wasn't sure where to apply myself.

So mesh networks.. I recently stared doing [some research](https://docs.google.com/a/wapolabs.com/document/d/1RFi6BzqTo-7Iu1tUMB9qt25wNLssDYGma4jfoTeP5ls/edit) on what they are, applications, and potential. In short a mesh network is a network without any of the things we hate about the web, ISPs like Comcast and the NSA tapping our every action, and a few amazing potential like helping people without ISPs in foreign countries talk to each other or in the event of a natural disaster (hypothetically let's say a large earthquake in California) people could get in touch even if cell towers go out.

My next question is now what? Do I go elsewhere?

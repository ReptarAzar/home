This is a small series of adventure films that I've shot using a GoPro. These are short (>2min), sloppily edited, and very fun to make. <!-- They also help me to remember and reflect. -->

>Wanderlust is a strong desire for or impulse to wander or travel and explore the world.

<!-- "The term originates from the German words wandern (to hike) and Lust (desire). The term wandern, frequently misused as a false friend, does in fact not mean 'to wander', but 'to hike.'" -->

###Jazz Fest

A short film from my first taste of New Orleans. Never have I experienced a culture so rich in America.

###Brooklyn bash

Another short video I shot with my friends in Brooklyn on a GoPro. This one is a bit more Sunlust than Wanderlust.

		<h4>My self-summary</h4>		
			<p>I'm kind of a geek? But in a good way...if that's even possible.</p>
			<p>I'm into girls with nice teeth, drunken dance-offs, the Washington Post, and dressing up as Abe Lincoln. Yeah you read that right.</p>
		<h4>What Iâ€™m doing with my life</h4>
			<p>I graduated from Syracuse University not too long ago and moved out here to work with The Washington Post as a designer for the WaPo Labs....so I guess that takes up most of my time.</p>
			<p>I do a lot of designing and coding, which is why I said that I'm a huge geek. I've created my fair share of websites and apps and all that; I'm a big fan of the idea that the Internet should be an interactive experience. I like to think that I make sweet shit online so that your life can be a little bit more interesting!</p>
		<h4>I'm really good at</h4>
			<p>Breaking the ice? Cooking. Graphic design. Seeing the good in shitty situations. Cycling. Dancing (although my last two throw downs would probably contradict that...) Drinking whiskey. Apples to Apples. Breaking things. Fixing things. Coming up with creative dates. Impromptu speeches.
			</p>
		<h4>The first things people usually notice about me</h4>
			<p>Not sure?</p>
		<h4>The six things I couldn't do without</h4>
			<p>My laptop, corny jokes, my little sister - she's the best, don't hate, a moleskine or comp book, and you!</p>
			<p>(See what I mean about the lame jokes?)</p>
			<p>Oh, and coffee. I take back the last answer.</p>

		<h4>I spend a lot of time thinking about</h4>
			<p>Quantum physics.</p>
		<h4>On a typical Friday night I am</h4>
			<p>Who wants a typical Friday night?</p>
